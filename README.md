This is where I put all my code that I made for Advent Of Code 2018.

Unlike most that simply rush to find the solution(which I don't find entertaining), I take my time when I can to create the optimal algorithm in complexity that I can make, especially when brute-forcing yields O(n)>=n<sup>2</sup>.

I am doing my best to comment out what goes inside my mind, I hope people will find my implementations interesting.

Language: C++
IDE: Visual Studio 2017
